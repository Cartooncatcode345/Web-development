    <h2>about honeybees</h2>
    <p>Honeybees are small, flying insects known for their crucial role in pollination and honey production. They are
        social creatures that live in colonies, which can consist of tens of thousands of bees. Each colony has a single
        queen, many worker bees, and some drones.</p>
    <p>The queen bee is the only fertile female in the colony. Her main role is to lay eggsâ€”up to 2,000 per day. Worker
        bees, which are all female, handle various tasks such as cleaning the hive, caring for young bees, gathering
        nectar, and making honey.</p>
    <p>Honeybees are essential pollinators. As they move from flower to flower collecting nectar, they transfer pollen,
        helping plants reproduce. This process supports the growth of fruits, vegetables, and nuts. Without honeybees,
        many of the foods we eat would become scarce.</p>
    <p>Honey is made when bees gather nectar and store it in their hives. They fan it with their wings to remove
        moisture, creating the thick, sweet substance we enjoy. Bees use honey as a food source, especially in winter.
    </p>
    <p>Sadly, honeybee populations are in decline due to pesticides, habitat loss, and disease. Protecting them is vital
        not just for honey, but for the health of our ecosystems and food supply.</p>
